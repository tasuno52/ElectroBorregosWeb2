                <h2>Your Personal Research Assistant: The "AI Lab Partner" ðŸ§ </h2>

                <p>We understand that scientific papers can be dense. That's why we've made a **Biological Support Chatbot** available to youâ€”it acts as your **AI Lab Partner**.</p>
                
                <p>This isn't just a welcome chatbot; it's your intelligent companion for navigating the science of microgravity. Use it to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Clarify Key Concepts:</strong> What exactly is "oxidative stress" or "auxin signaling" in the space context? Just ask.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Summarize Content:</strong> Ask it to give you a quick overview of the methodology or conclusions of a specific paper (mention the title or topic).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Connect Themes:</strong> Ask it how bone loss in mice relates to cardiovascular problems in astronauts. It will help you see the bigger picture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify Biological Models:</strong> What organism is being studied in that article? (Mice, *Arabidopsis*, *Drosophila*, etc.)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Don't waste time looking up definitions. The AI Lab Partner is designed to make the science flow uninterrupted, giving you direct insights needed for future mission planning. <a href="CHATBOT.html" target="medio" class="cta-link">Click here</a></p>
