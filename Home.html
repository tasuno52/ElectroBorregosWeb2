            Humanity is ready to return to the Moon and reach Mars. For these missions to be safe and successful, **biology is the most critical frontier**. For decades, NASA has sent thousands of living beings into space, generating a vast and complex library of more than 600 scientific publications that hold the keys to human survival beyond Earth. The problem is not a lack of information, but rather **access to it**.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge of Fragmented Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
                As a scientist, mission planner, or investment manager, you know that navigating hundreds of documents to identify a single knowledge gap or validate a hypothesis is a monumental task. Data is scattered across results, conclusions, and appendices, slowing progress toward creating effective countermeasures against microgravity and radiation.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Your Solution: Artificial Intelligence in Orbit </h2>
            <p>
                **"The Space Biology Knowledge Engine MK1.0"** is not a library; it's your research copilot powered by **AI and Knowledge Graphs**.
            </p>
            <p>
                We've transformed a mountain of publications into a **dynamic, interactive Dashboard**. Here you can:

            <ul class="benefit-list">
                <li><strong>Explore Key Impacts:</strong> Instantly discover how microgravity affects bone density, tissue regeneration, or cardiovascular health, based on consolidated evidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify Gaps:</strong> Use artificial intelligence to automatically point out areas of consensus, disagreement, or research gaps that need to be addressed before sending crews long distances.</li>
                <li><strong>Filter by Relevance:</strong> Interrogate the collection of studies (such as the papers on **mice in Bion-M 1** or the **immune response in *Drosophila***) and get precise summaries of key sections (Results vs. Conclusions).</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final-call">
                Your mission is crucial: Use this tool to make informed decisions that will get astronauts to the Moon and beyond **safely and efficiently.**
